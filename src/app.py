"""FastAPI application factory for EmailPOC.

This module performs all dependency wiring exactly once and exposes the
ready-to-serve :data:`app` object that Uvicorn imports
(``src.app:app``). The construction order is:

1. Load configuration (:func:`src.config.get_settings`).
2. Configure the single shared logger from ``LOG_LEVEL``.
3. Build the async Postgres engine/session factory.
4. Build the active email provider and inbound webhook parser from
   ``EMAIL_PROVIDER`` via their factories.
5. Assemble the :class:`ConversationService`.
6. Mount static directories, register templates and include the routes.

Every collaborator is attached to ``app.state`` so the thin handlers in
:mod:`src.route` can reach them without re-constructing anything.

Example:
    >>> from src.app import app          # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> app.title                        # doctest: +SKIP
    'EmailPOC'

def create_app() -> FastAPI:
    """Build, wire and return the FastAPI application.

    Construction is deliberately eager: if the configured provider is
    missing credentials, the matching factory raises immediately so the
    process fails fast at startup with a clear message rather than on the
    first request.

    Returns:
        FastAPI: A fully configured application with static mounts,
            templates and routes registered, and all collaborators stored on
            ``app.state``.

    Raises:
        ProviderConfigError: If ``EMAIL_PROVIDER`` is unknown or the active
            provider's required credentials are not set.

    Example:
        >>> app = create_app()           # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> "/webhooks/inbound" in {r.path for r in app.routes}  # noqa
