"""HTTP routes for EmailPOC — UI pages and the single inbound webhook.

This module contains **only** route declarations. Every handler is thin: it
reads request input, delegates to the shared
:class:`~src.services.conversation_service.ConversationService` (and the
Jinja2 templates) stored on ``request.app.state``, and returns a response.
All construction and wiring lives in :mod:`src.app`, so this file can be
read as a flat table of "URL → behaviour".

Every route below requires a logged-in user (see :mod:`src.auth`) except the
inbound webhook, which providers call anonymously.

Routes:

================ ====== ==============================================
Method + path           Purpose
================ ====== ==============================================
``GET /``               Redirect to ``/tracking``.
``GET /send``           Render the Send RFQ form.
``POST /send``          Create a conversation and send the RFQ.
``GET /tracking``       Personal dashboard: my stats + my conversations.
``GET /tracking/{c}``   Full conversation thread (ownership-checked).
``POST /tracking/{c}/delete`` Delete one of my conversations.
``POST /webhooks/inbound`` Receive an inbound reply (any provider).
``GET /webhooks/inbound``  Validation probe (Elastic Email GETs this).
================ ====== ==============================================

Example:
    >>> from src.route import router
    >>> from fastapi import FastAPI
    >>> app = FastAPI()
    >>> app.include_router(router)            # doctest: +SKIP
