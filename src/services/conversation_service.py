"""Conversation orchestration for EmailPOC.

:class:`ConversationService` is the single place that coordinates the
database, the active email provider and the active inbound webhook parser.
It exposes three high-level operations the routes call:

1. :meth:`ConversationService.create_conversation` – mint a conversation
   and its dynamic address.
2. :meth:`ConversationService.send_rfq` – render and send the RFQ email,
   then persist the sent record.
3. :meth:`ConversationService.handle_inbound` – parse an inbound webhook
   request, match it to a conversation, store attachments and the reply,
   and classify the supplier's response.

Keeping this logic out of the routes means the same flow works unchanged no
matter which provider is configured.

Example:
    >>> service = ConversationService(           # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     db, email_provider, webhook_parser, settings, logger)
    >>> conv = service.create_conversation("42", "buyer@acme.com", "Acme")
    >>> conv["status"]                            # doctest: +SKIP
    'open'
